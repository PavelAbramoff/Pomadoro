# Pomodoro timer

The Pomodoro Technique is a time management method developed by Francesco Cirillo in the late 1980s. It helps improve focus and productivity by breaking work into intervals, traditionally 25 minutes long, followed by short breaks. These intervals are called "pomodoros" â€” the Italian word for tomato, inspired by the tomato-shaped kitchen timer Cirillo used as a student.

Hereâ€™s how it works:

Choose a task: Pick one specific thing to work on.
Set a timer for 25 minutes: Focus on your task without distractions until the timer rings.
Work until the timer rings: Give your full attention to the task â€” no checking messages, emails, or social media.
Take a 5-minute break: Step away from your work to relax and recharge.
Repeat the cycle: After 4 pomodoros, take a longer break (15â€“30 minutes).
Why it works:
Reduces burnout: Frequent breaks help prevent mental fatigue.
Boosts motivation: Small, timed chunks make big tasks feel more manageable.
Improves focus: Knowing a break is coming makes it easier to stay on track.ðŸš€
